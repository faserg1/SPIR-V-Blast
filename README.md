# SPIR-V-Blast Translator
Converting the C-like language to binary or human readable SPIR-V. [Read more](LANGUAGE.md).

To compile this tool see [Compile the Blast Translator](COMPILE.md).

# About the language
This language is like "reinvented wheel".

Now, this language can:
 * Work with preprocessor defines and includes.
 * Work with base types.
 * Work with enums.
 * Work with structures.
 * Work with pointers (include cast to integer types and backwards).
 * Work with additional capabilities.

In theory, this language supposed to:
 * Work with math.
 * Work with logical branches.
 * Work with loops.

Also, I wish to add the next features:
 * Work with classes.
